## OCPS v0.2 Roadmap Planning

This issue will track planning and discussion for **OCPS v0.2**. The goal is to expand our open, on-chain DAO transparency toolkit with:

âœ… **DAO Nutrition Label Standardization**  
Refine the format and categories for DAO transparency reporting.

âœ… **Automated IPFS Pinning + Attestation Logging**  
Explore GitHub Actions or lightweight scripts to automate pinning and update logs seamlessly.

âœ… **Contributor Workflow**  
Add CONTRIBUTING.md with clear steps for submitting DAO transparency profiles and attestations.

âœ… **Documentation Expansion**  
Include detailed on-chain attestation tutorials for contributors.

âœ… **Community Education Assets**  
DAO transparency explainer visuals, X posts, and short video snippets.
