## OCPS v0.3 Roadmap (Draft)

### Goal:
Enable `dao://` URI discoverability and JSON-LD compatibility for OCPS profiles to align with EIP-4824 while maintaining Metal Blockchain first support.

### Proposed Milestones:
✅ Research JSON-LD schema structures aligned with OCPS YAML/JSON profiles.  
✅ Build a JSON-LD export function for OCPS profiles.  
✅ Test integration with potential `dao://` URI resolvers.  
✅ Update documentation for DAO certification with `dao://` discoverability.  
✅ Optional: Propose integration to Metal DAO or XPR DAO for on-chain URI record alignment.

### Benefits:
- Cross-chain interoperability.
- Enhanced DAO discoverability.
- Alignment with Ethereum DAO ecosystem standards while retaining Metal Blockchain first certification focus.
