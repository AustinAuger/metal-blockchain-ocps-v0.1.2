# Metal Blockchain OCPS Vision Document

## Purpose
To establish an open, community-driven, transparent, and reproducible standard for measuring decentralization in DAOs and blockchain projects using the Metal Blockchain ecosystem.

## Why This Matters
- Regulators seek clear metrics on decentralization.
- Communities deserve verifiable claims, not marketing fluff.
- It strengthens trust in the Metal Blockchain ecosystem.

## Our Vision
A world where:
✅ Projects can certify their decentralization progress.  
✅ DAOs can transparently report governance evolution.  
✅ Communities and regulators can verify decentralization claims easily.
